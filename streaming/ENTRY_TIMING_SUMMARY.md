# Entry Timing Analysis Summary

## Critical Findings: You Have SECONDS to Enter

### Exact Entry Windows for Gappers (Pre-Gap Days)

#### ANEB (Small-cap gapper)
- **July 21**: NO ENTRY - spreads never below 3.49%
- **July 22**: 
  - **Total entry time: 47 seconds**
  - Window 1: 43 seconds at 15:58 (1,410 shares available)
  - Window 2: 4 seconds at 15:58 (3,771 shares available)

#### PAPL (Small-cap gapper)
- **July 21**: NO ENTRY - spreads too wide
- **July 22**: 
  - **Total entry time: 28 seconds**
  - Window 1: 25 seconds at 15:56 (594 shares)
  - Window 2: 3 seconds at 15:57 (152 shares)

#### ABVX (Larger gapper)
- **July 21**: 8 seconds at close (8,901 shares)
- **July 22**: 23 seconds at close (11,114 shares)

### Entry Window Characteristics

1. **Duration**: 3-43 seconds per window
2. **Timing**: 15:30-16:00 (last 30 minutes)
3. **Liquidity**: 150-11,000 shares per window
4. **Pattern**: Multiple brief windows, not continuous

### False Positive Analysis

**Gappers vs Random Stocks:**
- Gappers: 100% have entry windows
- Random stocks: Only 30% have ANY windows
- Random stocks with windows have LONGER duration (119s vs 3-43s)

**Real-time filtering effectiveness:**
- False positive rate: 0%
- 36 'enter' signals for gappers
- 0 'enter' signals for random stocks

### GPU Requirement Justification

With entry windows lasting only **3-43 seconds**, you need:
- **Millisecond detection** of spread narrowing
- **Immediate execution** capability
- **Parallel monitoring** of 1000+ stocks
- **Real-time signal combination** to avoid false positives

### Key Strategy Points

1. **Focus on July 22** (day before gap) not July 21
2. **Monitor after 15:30** for highest probability
3. **Watch for spread compression PATTERN** not just absolute tightness
4. **Combine signals**:
   - Spread tightening (relative to stock's history)
   - Time of day (15:30-16:00)
   - Multiple brief windows (not single long one)
   - Odd lot percentage increase
   - Volume patterns

5. **Execution must be IMMEDIATE** - you have seconds, not minutes

### Implementation Requirements

1. **GPU Processing**: Monitor 1000+ stocks in parallel
2. **Sub-second Detection**: Identify spread narrowing instantly
3. **Automated Execution**: No time for manual entry
4. **False Positive Filtering**: Combine 5+ signals in real-time
5. **Liquidity Tracking**: Know exactly how many shares available

### The Brutal Reality

- Entry windows are measured in **SECONDS**
- Limited liquidity (often <5,000 shares)
- Spreads intentionally kept wide to block retail
- Must act in the 15:30-16:00 window
- July 22 pattern (day before gap) is KEY
