So, for now you will need to create a simple simulator to generate the data like as if was being done by IQfeed.
Also the current system has a higher version of cuda. eventually we will use cuda 10.0 or perhaps even cuda 9..
When it comes to the simulator, note that we have installed IQFEED now! so use real data! no need to fake simulations. you can download historical data and then stream it via the simulator like as it it was real.



# Advanced Signals for Stealthy Pre-Pump Accumulation (Our Unique Edge)
These signals are designed to capture the intent of institutions trying to acquire shares without moving the price or widening the spread prematurely. They rely heavily on real-time Level 2 and tick data processing.

1. Sustained Bid-Side Absorption with Stable (or Narrowing) Spread:

What it is: The stock is experiencing continuous, moderate selling pressure (trades hitting the bid), but the best bid price holds firm, and the bid-ask spread remains stable or even subtly tightens.

Why it's unique/important: This isn't just "positive OFI" that pushes price. This is demand absorbing supply without allowing the price to drop. It's a hallmark of a large buyer patiently sweeping up shares. If the spread remains good, it confirms the demand is passive (resting bids) but persistent.

Detection Logic:

Monitor sequence of trades: many trades executed at or near the best bid.

Simultaneously monitor L2: the best bid depth (size) depletes, but is rapidly replenished at the same price (iceberg behavior) or the price doesn't drop below.

Check spread: (Current Spread - Recent Average Spread (e.g., 5s, 10s)) should be close to zero or negative.

GPU Role: Crucial for detecting this across 2000 stocks. It involves concurrent L2 monitoring, trade classification, and real-time spread/depth analysis.

2. Controlled Price Creep on Low Relative Volume (Order Book Driven):

What it is: The mid-price of the stock (or even the BBP) slowly and consistently ticks upwards (e.g., 1-2 cents over 10-30 seconds), but this price increase is accompanied by:

Unusually low total volume for the magnitude of price change (compared to historical volume-to-price-change ratios).

Frequent "liftings" of the best offer: Small-to-medium size aggressive buy orders hitting the best ask, causing the best ask to move up, but then new offers quickly appear at the new level. This is not a "gap," but a deliberate, slow push.

Why it's unique/important: This signals a buyer who is willing to pay up slightly but wants to avoid aggressive buying that would quickly widen the spread or alert others. It's often market makers responding to sustained demand, pushing the price up in small increments.

Detection Logic:

Real-time Mid-Price velocity: Delta_MidPrice / Delta_Time is positive but below a certain threshold (e.g., < 0.05% per second).

Volume-to-Price-Change Ratio: (Total Volume in window) / (Net Mid-Price Change in window) is unusually low.

L2 Observation: Observe the best offer consistently moving up after being hit by small aggressive orders.

GPU Role: Excellent for parallel mid-price calculation, volume tracking, and ratio analysis across all stocks.

3. Inferred Dark Pool Accumulation (Pre-Reported):

What it is: Detection of significant trading activity that occurs off-exchange, where the executed volume appears on the consolidated tape after the fact, but the real-time L2 on the public exchanges (lit venues) shows very little corresponding trade volume or order book movement to explain the price action.

Why it's unique/important: This is a strong indication of large, hidden institutional accumulation via dark pools. We infer it by the discrepancy between what happens on public L2 and what's reported on the consolidated tape.

Detection Logic:

Monitor (Mid-Price Change) over X seconds.

Monitor (Total Volume from Consolidated Tape) over X seconds.

Monitor (Volume of Trades Executed on Lit Exchanges) over X seconds (from classified trades on public venues).

Signal: IF (Mid-Price Change > Threshold) AND (Total Volume from Consolidated Tape > Threshold) AND (Lit Exchange Trade Volume / Total Volume from Consolidated Tape < Low_Threshold) THEN INFERRED_DARK_POOL_ACCUMULATION.

GPU Role: Ideal for processing incoming consolidated trade ticks and comparing them to the real-time L2 updates and lit trade executions across thousands of symbols.

4. Sustained, Positive Liquidity Sinkhole:

What it is: Not just an iceberg, but a persistent, deep order book demand (e.g., many orders on the bid side across multiple levels) that seems to consistently absorb selling pressure without depleting, combined with the stock trading near its low.

Why it's unique/important: This is active price support. It signals a large player who is willing to continually provide liquidity on the bid side to prevent further price drops, allowing them to accumulate at or below a certain price.

Detection Logic:

Monitor total accumulated bid depth across N levels (e.g., top 10 levels).

Monitor the (volume of trades hitting the bid) vs. (depletion of bid depth) ratio. If volume is high but depth depletes slowly, or replenishes quickly after depletion, it indicates a sinkhole.

Check for price near recent lows (Current Price / Recent Min Price (e.g., 5-day) > 0.95).

GPU Role: Compute total depth, track depletion/replenishment ratios for many stocks.

5. Micro-Volatility Contraction with Upward Bias:

What it is: The spread between the highest bid and lowest ask (or even the high/low of individual ticks) becomes unusually tight, implying a high degree of confidence or control over price. When this combines with an upward bias in mid-price.

Why it's unique/important: This can be a sign of a "market maker" or a large participant actively controlling the bid-ask spread to facilitate accumulation without alarming others. It shows a tight leash on price.

Detection Logic:

Real-time Average Spread (e.g., 5s) / Historical Average Spread (e.g., 1hr) is very low (e.g., < 0.5).

Standard Deviation of Mid-Price (e.g., 5s window) is contracting.

Combined with a Positive Micro-Price Velocity.

GPU Role: Calculate real-time spread metrics, mid-price standard deviation, and velocity for all stocks.

These signals are more nuanced, often combining multiple real-time microstructure metrics, and aim to detect the intent of stealthy accumulation. This requires your high-fidelity L2 data and the parallel processing power of your GPUs to calculate and monitor them across 2000 stocks concurrently.

# Minimum Number of Kafka Streams (Topics):
Yes, for a clean and efficient design, you will need a minimum of 3 separate Kafka topics (streams) for your raw IQFeed data, at least initially.

iqfeed.l2.raw (or market-data.l2.raw):

Content: All raw Level 2 order book updates (Add/Modify/Delete operations) for all 2000 stocks.

Message Key: Stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL").

Why separate? L2 data is extremely high volume and has a unique message format and update nature (state changes). Separating it allows consumers interested only in L2 to subscribe efficiently.

iqfeed.trades.raw (or market-data.trades.raw):

Content: All raw trade executions (price, size, timestamp, conditions).

Message Key: Stock symbol.

Why separate? Trade data is also high volume and distinct. Your microstructure processing needs to differentiate between L2 updates and actual trades (e.g., for OFI calculation where trades are classified).

iqfeed.quotes.raw (or market-data.quotes.raw):

Content: All raw Level 1 NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) quote updates (best bid/ask price and size) if IQFeed provides them distinctly from trade messages. Sometimes quotes are merged into trade streams or are less granular if not specifically subscribed to.

Message Key: Stock symbol.

Why separate? Useful for precise bid-ask spread tracking, calculating mid-price, and trade classification. If IQFeed's trade messages implicitly contain sufficient quote info, you might combine this, but generally, a separate quote stream is cleaner for real-time processing.




# IQFeed Raw Data Message Formats (Common Fields)
When you request historical tick data (HIT, HTX commands) or stream real-time data, IQConnect.exe will send you lines of text that look something like this. Your Python client will need to parse these lines.

1. Level 2 (Market Depth) Data Format (S,WATCH_LIST_DEPTH command, then L messages)
This is complex as it's a stream of updates to the order book. Each message describes an operation (add, modify, delete) at a specific position.

Message Type: L (for Level 2 updates)

Example Raw Line (Conceptual, fields are defined by position in the string):
L,[Symbol],[Level],[MarketMaker],[Operation],[Side],[Price],[Size],[TickID],[Timestamp]

CSV Column Headers:

MessageType: String (e.g., "L") - Not directly from IQFeed stream but useful for parsing

Symbol: String (e.g., "AAPL")

Level: Integer (e.g., 0 for best bid/ask, 1 for next, etc. - typically 0-9 for MBP-10)

MarketMaker: String (MPID of the market maker/exchange - e.g., "EDGX", "ARCA")

Operation: Integer (0=Insert, 1=Update, 2=Delete)

Side: Integer (0=Ask, 1=Bid)

Price: Float (e.g., 175.50)

Size: Integer (e.g., 100, 500)

TickID: Long Integer (Unique ID for the tick, useful for ordering/deduplication)

Timestamp: String (e.g., "2025-07-21 16:57:51.123456" - IQFeed provides millisecond precision, possibly microsecond if available from exchange feed)

Notes on L2:

You'll get a stream of these L messages. Your order_book_manager.py will use these to reconstruct the current Level 2 state.

The TickID is crucial for ensuring correct ordering of events, especially if you have multiple streams or need to re-sort.

2. Trades Data Format (T messages for tick data, HTT for historical tick)
This represents individual executed trades.

Message Type: T (for Streaming Trades) or [date] ... (for Historical Tick)

Example Raw Line (Conceptual, for real-time T message):
T,[Symbol],[TradeTime],[Last],[LastSize],[TotalVolume],[TradeMarketCenter],[TradeConditions],[TickID]

CSV Column Headers (for Historical Trades, like from HTT/HIT command format):

Timestamp: String (e.g., "2025-07-21 16:57:51.123456") - IQFeed provides millisecond precision timestamps for ticks (Source 2.3).

Symbol: String (e.g., "AAPL")

TradePrice: Float (Price of the executed trade)

TradeSize: Integer (Size of the executed trade)

TotalVolume: Integer (Running total volume for the day - may or may not be included in every tick message, often a Level 1 field)

TradeMarketCenter: String (Exchange ID where the trade occurred - e.g., "NYSE", "NASDAQ", "BATS")

TradeConditions: String (Codes indicating conditions like "regular trade," "odd lot," "extended hours" - e.g., "R", "C", "T" - often multiple comma-separated codes)

TickID: Long Integer (Unique ID for the tick)

BidPrice: Float (Bid at time of trade - often part of expanded tick data)

AskPrice: Float (Ask at time of trade - often part of expanded tick data)

Notes on Trades:

IQFeed's HTT (historical tick) command usually returns [time],[last],[size],[total volume],[bid],[ask],[id],[tick type] (Source 4.5). The specific fields for HTT can be configured.

The TradeConditions field is critical for filtering out-of-market trades (pre/post-market, odd lots) if your strategy focuses only on regular trading hours.

The BidPrice and AskPrice at the time of trade are extremely valuable for classifying trades as buyer-initiated (trade at ask or higher) or seller-initiated (trade at bid or lower), which is key for OFI.

3. Quotes Data Format (Q messages for real-time quotes, usually combined with T for historical ticks)
IQFeed often integrates Level 1 quotes directly into its tick messages (T messages often contain the current Bid/Ask) or provides them via a dedicated streaming client. For historical tick files (e.g., from HTT), the bid/ask at time of trade are usually included.

Message Type: Q (for real-time Quote updates) or as part of a T message.

Example Raw Line (Conceptual, for real-time Q message):
Q,[Symbol],[BidPrice],[BidSize],[AskPrice],[AskSize],[BidMarketCenter],[AskMarketCenter],[Timestamp],[TickID]

CSV Column Headers (if separate from trades):

Timestamp: String

Symbol: String

BidPrice: Float

BidSize: Integer

AskPrice: Float

AskSize: Integer

BidMarketCenter: String (Exchange ID of best bid)

AskMarketCenter: String (Exchange ID of best ask)

TickID: Long Integer

Creating Your CSVs for Backtesting
When creating your CSV files (AAPL_L2_20250601.csv, AAPL_Trades_20250601.csv, etc.), ensure:

Consistent Headers: Use the column headers defined above (or slight variations if you find IQFeed's actual output differs slightly for your specific subscription/protocol version).

Matching Data Types: Ensure your simulated data matches these types (e.g., Price as float, Size as integer).

Timestamp Format: Use a precise, consistent timestamp format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS.ffffff for microsecond precision). IQFeed often uses HH:mm:SS.ffffff for intraday, with date implied by the file or request.

Chronological Order: Crucially, ensure all rows within each CSV file are strictly sorted by Timestamp in ascending order. This is vital for your event-driven backtesting.

By using these schemas, you'll create historical data files that perfectly mimic what your IQFeed client will see live, allowing for highly accurate backtesting. The IQFeed API documentation (search for "DTN IQFeed API docs" and look for the "Level 2 via TCP/IP" and "Historical via TCP/IP" sections) will be your definitive guide for precise field definitions and message parsing.



# How to Integrate Early (The "Ugly GPU Python" Phase):
You're essentially creating a hybrid "Ugly CPU/GPU Python" backtesting phase:

Core Microstructure Logic (microstructure_analysis/):

Start writing your order_book_manager.py and feature_calculator.py with Numba (@jit) decorators from day one.

For CPU testing, Numba will compile these to optimized CPU code.

For GPU testing/development, you'll specifically add @cuda.jit for functions intended for GPU, and leverage numba.cuda APIs.

Initially, you might have some functions with both @jit and @cuda.jit versions, or use conditional logic to switch between CPU/GPU implementations for testing.

Hardware Setup:

This means your primary development machine (the Supermicro) needs to have your K1 GPUs installed and configured with appropriate drivers and CUDA Toolkit (10.x).

You'll set up your Linux VM with PCIe passthrough for at least one of your GK107 GPUs.

Data Flow (Kafka In):

Your ingestion/kafka_producer.py (for historical CSVs) will push into your Kafka topics (iqfeed.l2.raw, iqfeed.trades.raw).

Your backtesting/engine.py will contain the Kafka consumer logic that feeds these raw messages to your microstructure_analysis module.

Signal Output (Kafka Out):

Your microstructure_analysis modules will output processed features and signals (e.g., to processed_features/ or directly to an in-memory structure for the backtester).

In the future, for real-time, these would go to your trading.signals Kafka topic and Redis.

Conclusion:

Given your clear understanding of the "Kafka in, Kafka out" model and your desire for a smooth transition, integrating GPU acceleration (starting with one GPU) into your microstructure_analysis component during the current "ugly Python" backtesting phase is a highly advisable strategic move. It fronts some of the setup complexity but dramatically reduces future rework and validates the core performance aspect of your unique edge much earlier.




# Numba, PyTorch, TensorFlow: Your Go-To Stack
Given the limitations of RAPIDS with Kepler, and the nature of your workload, sticking with Python, Numba, and potentially older versions of PyTorch/TensorFlow is absolutely the right route for your core GPU processing.

Numba (@cuda.jit):

Direct Control & Optimization: This allows you to write custom CUDA kernels directly in Python, giving you the fine-grained control needed to optimize order book reconstruction, OFI calculation, and iceberg detection (Source 2.1, 2.3, 2.4).

Kepler Compatibility: Numba supports older CUDA Toolkits (like 10.2), which are compatible with your K1s (Source 1.5, 2.5). This makes it a feasible path.

Low Overhead: Numba compiles Python code directly to machine code, minimizing Python overhead for the numerical crunching (Source 2.2).

PyTorch / TensorFlow (Older Versions):

For your "small ML models," you'll need older versions of these frameworks that compile against CUDA 10.2 (e.g., PyTorch 1.6-1.8, TensorFlow 2.2-2.4).

While challenging to set up initially, once compiled/installed correctly, they provide a powerful framework for GPU-accelerated neural network inference.

CuPy:

This is another excellent library that provides a NumPy-like API for GPU arrays (Source 2.3). It can be very useful for general array manipulations on the GPU before feeding data to custom Numba kernels or ML models. It's often compatible if your CUDA/Python environment is set up for Numba/PyTorch
