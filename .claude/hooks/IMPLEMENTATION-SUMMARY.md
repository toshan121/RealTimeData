# .claude-hooks-ignore Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Functionality
- Added `should_skip_file` function to `common-helpers.sh` that checks:
  - `.claude-hooks-ignore` file with gitignore-style patterns
  - Inline `claude-hooks-disable` comments in the first 5 lines of files
- Supports glob patterns (`*.pb.go`), directory patterns (`vendor/**`), and exact matches

### 2. Updated All Linters
- **Go linter** (`lint-go.sh`): Filters files before checking forbidden patterns
- **Tilt linter** (`lint-tilt.sh`): Filters Tiltfiles before linting
- **Python linter** (in `smart-lint.sh`): Filters Python files before running black/ruff
- **JavaScript linter** (in `smart-lint.sh`): Filters JS/TS files before prettier/eslint
- **Rust linter** (in `smart-lint.sh`): Filters Rust files before cargo fmt/clippy
- **Nix linter** (in `smart-lint.sh`): Filters Nix files before nixpkgs-fmt

### 3. Updated All Test Runners
- **Go tests** (`test-go.sh`): Skips tests for ignored files
- **Python tests** (`smart-test.sh`): Skips tests for ignored files
- **JavaScript tests** (`smart-test.sh`): Skips tests for ignored files
- **Tilt tests** (`test-tilt.sh`): Skips tests for ignored files

### 4. Documentation
- Created `.claude-hooks-ignore.example` with comprehensive examples
- Updated `README.md` with detailed documentation on:
  - How to use `.claude-hooks-ignore`
  - How to use inline `claude-hooks-disable` comments
  - Legitimate use cases for exclusions
  - Warning about using exclusions sparingly

### 5. Logging
- All skipped files are logged with `log_debug` when `CLAUDE_HOOKS_DEBUG=1`
- Clear messages indicate why files were skipped (which pattern matched)

## How It Works

1. When a linter/tester processes files, it calls `should_skip_file` for each file
2. `should_skip_file` checks:
   - If `.claude-hooks-ignore` exists, reads patterns and checks for matches
   - If the file has `claude-hooks-disable` in the first 5 lines
3. Files are filtered out BEFORE any processing, saving time
4. Glob patterns use bash's `case` statement for proper matching

## Testing

Created and verified functionality with test scripts that confirmed:
- Glob patterns work (`*.pb.go` matches `test.pb.go`)
- Directory patterns work (`vendor/**` matches `vendor/pkg/file.go`)
- Inline comments work (`// claude-hooks-disable`)
- Comments and empty lines in `.claude-hooks-ignore` are properly ignored

## Best Practices

The implementation encourages responsible use:
- Clear documentation on when to use exclusions
- Examples show legitimate use cases (generated code, vendor directories)
- Emphasis on temporary exclusions with TODO comments
- Goal remains 100% clean code
